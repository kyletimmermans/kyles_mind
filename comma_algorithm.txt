For every list of items that is separated by commas, there will be 
will always be n - 1 number of commas, with n being the number of items.

This is due to the fact that each item in a list will have a comma, besides
the last item, because there are no items left after the final item, so there
is no need for a comma at the end.

Nothing left, so take out the last comma.

Every item = n
Besides the last one = -1



E.g.

[fruits, vegetables, bread]

3 items, but the last one does not
take a comma because there are no mroe
items after the last one, so 3 - 1 = 2 commas
