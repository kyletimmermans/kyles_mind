How would calculate the age of your parent when you were born?

They concieved you "your current age" years ago, they had you at 1 and now you are "your current age"

Take your parents' current age, they had you x years ago, take their age into the past with you x years ago

They are 50

You are 20

THey had you 20 years ago, now they are 50 so we take them back 20 years

50 - 20 = 30

They were 30 years old when you were born

Diagram:
