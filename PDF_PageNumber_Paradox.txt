Sometimes when we have a PDF of a book or article that has its own page numbers,
the page numbers of the PDF and the page numbers of the actual book sometimes will not match.

How can this be? Shouldn't each page be 1-for-1 in terms of page numbers? They do
contain the same number of pages.

Here is why this can happen:

A PDF will number each page from the beginning. No matter what sort of material
lays on the first page or first several pages, it starts by labelling it as 'Page 1'.

The issue comes into play when the actual book material starts with a page that it is not numbered or was not supposed to be numbered. This could be a title page, cover art, index, etc.

The PDF has begun to alread number pages while the actual book has not, almost like the PDF reader has a head start.

For example:


PDF Reader Page Numbers    |     Actual Book Numbers  
_____________________________________________________
						   |						  _
			1			   |          Cover Art        |
						   |						   |   
			2			   |		  Title Page       |  Buffer Pages
						   |						   |
			3			   |			Index         _|
						   |						   	
			4			   |			  1
						   |
			5			   |			  2
						   |			
			6			   |	          3
						   | 
			7			   |              4


So here we can see that the PDF reads out page 7 for the book
that reads page 4.

It is the buffer pages in the beginning of the book that cause the book
to count out slower and have smaller numbers while the PDF Reader counts from the
get go and has higher numbers in comparison to the book. 

Another example of this:

One person starts counting and another person starts counting a minute after the
first person starts. The first person will already be at higher numbers where as the 
second person will have smaller numbers because they started later. 


Equations:

If we want to get the actual number of the book and we only have the PDF Reader page number,
we need to take the number of buffer pages and subtract it from the PDF Reader.

I.e. Catching up to the larger number

actual page number = PDF Reader number - # of buffer pages in book.


If we want to get the PDF Reader number but only have the actual book number,
we need to add on the buffer pages to our current page number.

I.e. Slow down to the smaller number

PDF Reader number = actual page number + # of buffer pages


PDF Page Number = Buffer Pages + Actual Page Number
				  - Buffer Page

Subtract the Buffer Pages to get the Actual Page
