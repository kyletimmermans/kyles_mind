Wicked.py Logic
---------------

Wicked is a program used to find the people that you follow,
but don't follow you back.


Example:

Followers            Following
    4			 5


We must remove the bot followers or accounts that I will
not follow back when considering the "true follower account".

If I take the people in "Followers" out of "Following",
the only people left are the people that I follow, but don't
follow me back

  Followers                Following

 [   Bot   ]              [ User #1 ]
 [ User #1 ]       	  [ User #2 ]
 [ User #2 ]		  [ User #3 ]	
 [ User #3 ]		  [ User #4 ]
            		  [ User #5 ]


We can take out User #1, #2, and #3 from "Following"
because they exist in "Followers" so they follow me back
and they are not the one's to worry about. It is User #4
and User #5 who do not follow me back.

Notice how I did not include the bot, as I will never truly
be following everyone back that follows me. It may be tempting to
just do Following - Followers to see the difference and use
that raw number, but in reality, the actual equation is:

Number of followers that don't follow back = Following - (Followers - Accts I don't follow back)

*If they are in Following but not in Followers, they do not follow back
*Why do we subtract from the "Following" column? Because that is where the people
who don't follow us back are positioned. We need to chip away at the column to get 
to the actual usernames by subtracting the bots from followers and then the actual
followers out of following to give us all the people who we follow but are not
following us.
*We can not subtract all the followers from following, e.g. the bot, because
this does not exist in following, thus we can not chip it away from following.
I.e. We do not follow back bots or certain people back so they can not be in following, 
and if they're not in following, we don't worry about them, as we're only concerned
with a select few in the following list.

** We only want to remove the people in following that also exist in followers,
therefore they must be in the following list and in the followers list. People I don't
follow back (bots), will not be in the following list, because I don't follow them.
The resulting list will have all the following - the right amount of followers.

** People who follow me but I don't follow back are neither duplicates found in following
and followers to be removed from following, nor are they people I follow who don't follow me back
(found in following)
