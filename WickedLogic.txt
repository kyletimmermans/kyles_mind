Wicked.py Logic
---------------

Wicked is a program used to find the people that you follow,
but don't follow you back.


Example:

Followers            Following
    4			 5


We must remove the bot followers or accounts that I will
not follow back when considering the "true follower account".

If I take the people in "Followers" out of "Following",
the only people left are the people that I follow, but don't
follow me back

  Followers               Following

 [   Bot   ]              [ User #1 ]
 [ User #1 ]       	    [ User #2 ]
 [ User #2 ]		  [ User #3 ]	
 [ User #3 ]		  [ User #4 ]
            		  [ User #5 ]


We can take out User #1, #2, and #3 from "Following"
because they exist in "Followers" so they follow me back
and they are not the one's to worry about. It is User #4
and User #5 who do not follow me back.

Notice how I did not include the bot, as I will never truly
be following everyone back that follows me. It may be tempting to
just do Following - Followers to see the difference and use
that raw number. but in reality, the actual equation is:

Number of followers that don't follow back = Following - (Followers - Accts I don't follow back)

*If they are in Following but not in Followers, they do not follow back
