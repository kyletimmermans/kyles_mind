Timezones

While we wait for the sun to come from
one to place to another, East to West,
the time still passes by in the first
place.

Thus, the time in the East will be later
than in the West because the Sun is closer
to the West now and it is more day while the
Sun is farther from the East and is more night.


Sun moving East to West:

-Place 1 is two hours ahead of Place 2
