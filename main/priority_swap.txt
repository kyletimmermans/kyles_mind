System 1:
6 is highest priority and 1 is lowest priority

6 5 4 3 2 1

System 2:
1 is highest priority and 6 is lowest priority

1 2 3 4 5 6


System 1 --> System 2:

6 --> 1
5 --> 2
4 --> 3
3 --> 4
2 --> 5
1 --> 6

The highest priority was 6 now it's 1, the lowest priority was 1 and now it's 6
We can map out the old highest to the new highest, the old lowest to the new
lowest and then do the rest.

* Essentially just reversing the order of the first
