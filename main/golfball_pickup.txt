When picking up golfballs at the range, it is better to pickup two at a time instead of one.
Bend down, get one, bend down, get one.
Or
Bend down, get two, bend down, get two.

You cut down the amount of times you bend down by half.

When picking up 2 at a time, you are merging the second half you
would be getting with 1 at a time, with the first half.

    1st Half       |       2nd Half
        
o   o   o   o   o  |  o   o   o   o   o
+1  +1  +1  +1  +1   |               |
 ^              ^    |               |
 |              |____|               | 
 |                                   |

 Now there is just one half that we need to pickup when 
 we grab 2 at a time:
 
 o o o o o
 o o o o o
 
 We merged the second half into the first half so we cut the amount the amount of times
 we need to bend down by 2 because the other half we needed to bend down for is gone.
 
 With this strategy, the algorithm is to just take the number of golfballs you need to pickup
 and divide by 2, as each ball will be paired with another, removing half and keeping the first half's
 number.
 
 Divide golf ball number by 2, keep the first half of balls as the final number.
