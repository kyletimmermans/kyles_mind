Century numbering works sort of like arrays.

The numbering of centuries starts with the 0-99
years so everything is pushed down 1, just like
array indexing because arrays start at 0.

Centuries start from the 1st century but
the first century is the years 0-99

1st Century     2nd Century     3rd Century   
   0-99		  100-199	  200-299      ....



Not:

1 2 3
1 2 3 ...

It is:

1 2 3
0 1 2


Therefore,
	-The 14th century is the 1300s
	-The 19th century is the 1800s
	-The 20th century is the 1900s
	-The 21st century is the 2000s


Equations:

Century name is [xx]00s with xx+1

Century number is [xx]00s with xx-1
