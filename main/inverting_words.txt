Let's say you want to put a sign up in your window
that people outside could read.

You can't put it in the window so you can read it while
inside, it will look backwards to the people outside.

That's because their point of view is opposite of yours.
So if we read English left to right, you have to swap sides 
and write it right to left. And since it's opposite for them, 
they'll be able to read it left to right.


	  	 		      Window
        				V

					|
					|S
           Outside			|u	  	   Inside
  Reads right to left as Sup?		|p      Reads left to right as ?puS
					|?
					|	


What about languages that are read right to left e.g. Arabic?

The same principle applies, the people outside have
a different point of view, so we need to write left to right,
so that their inverted view gets the word going from right to left.

			   	  you're in a third person perspective
			        such as being on the side / inside of the 
			         wall and being on both sides at once



We can imagine our perspective being at either end of the window:
*Keep in mind this a top down perspective of the window
						
		 
		   We can imagine the perspective being on this end of the window

        	   L				|                          R

Criss-Cross to get the other
perspectives left and right:
