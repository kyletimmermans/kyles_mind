When determining the maximum value a number on a computer
can have, we need to consider that 0 is a number that this
number can take the value of.

For instance, an 8-bit integer has 256 different values.
But, it's maximum value is only 255. That's because we don't
start from 1, but rather from 0. Because of this, everything
shifts down 1, including the maximum.

* 0 is counted as 1 number, that is one less slot
  that the maximum could be.

* Take off from the end and add to the beginning
  	- Imagine 1-256, we take 1 off from 256 so we can
  	  start from 0, now it's 0-255


	256

    	/ \
       /   \
      /	    \
     0     1-255
     |       |
     1  +   255 = 256 different numbers
