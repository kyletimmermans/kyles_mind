// A program designed to automatically leave a zoom call
// when a majority of people leave, indicating
// then end of a meeting / class.

# At beginning of call, get the normal amount
# of people that should be there

normal_amount_of_students = zoomCall.numOfParticipants

* If there are less than half the number of the normal amount students 
in the call, then a majority of people left, therefore, class is most 
likely over and we can leave

Number of students:			[ ]  <-- Number of students that left (More than half)
							[ ]
							[x]  <-- Number of students still there (Less than half)
